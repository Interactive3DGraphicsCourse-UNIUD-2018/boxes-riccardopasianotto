# Project Journal

**Progress log** 
*  First thoughts on project. Main idea: create e scene that will represent a plane flying over a forest.
Naturally each object of the scene has to be made of `BoxGeometry` instances. 
I think I'll use the starting file with lights.
First of all I need to setup the overall environment and project files to be more productive as possible.
* Environment setup completed. Moved all js from the `script` tag inside the HTML DOM into a `main.js` file inside a new `project` folder.
* First sketches drawn on paper. Now I'll start a simple implementation of the basic idea.
