# Project Journal

**Progress log** 
*  First thoughts on project. Main idea: create e scene that will represent a plane flying over a forest.
Naturally each object of the scene has to be made of `BoxGeometry` instances. 
I think I'll use the starting file with lights.
First of all I need to setup the overall environment and project files to be more productive as possible.
